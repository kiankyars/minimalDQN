# minimalDQN
- minimal application of DQN on cartpole using the standard algorithm from the Deepmind paper on dqn.ipynb
- DDQN applied on ddqn.ipynb (only one line of code is changed, since the target network is used as a proxy for the second q-network which chooses actions, while the main model is still evaluating them)
